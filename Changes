The following logs changes for the CPAN distribution Template::Pure

0.011   22 March 2016
        - Now if the result of a scalar action is an object that does 'TO_HTML' we
          process the object rather than stringify it.

0.010   21 March 2016
        - I'm setting the minimum Perl version to 5.10.0 since we are using
          some regular expression constructs that only work on 5.10+ and its making
          the testing reports noisy.  I'd love to support 5.8.8 if I could, if anyone
          is a regexp ninja and wants to help, the issue is in Template::Pure::ParseUtils
          where I am using named/number capture buffers (that requires 5.10+).  If we can
          redo that regexp to not use those features that would grant us 5.8 compatibility.

0.009   17 March 2016
        - Make sure templates state is properly reset.

0.008   17 March 2016
        - Fixed issue with wrapper templates
        - New Feature: you may now set a template object in the data section
          and expect it to render.

0.007   16 March 2016
        - You may now assign the value of an action to any object that does
          a method called 'TO_HTML'.

0.006   15 March 2016
        - Removed some testing code accidentally left in the distribution
          in the last release

0.005   14 March 2016
        - pod tests and pod fixes (manwar++)
        - Setup for Travis CI
        - Tweaked some regular expressions for compatibility with more
          versions of Perl
        - new feature: let you assign a the target of a data context directly
          to a sub template.

0.004   14 March 2016
        - Rename Utils to ParseUtils
        - Fixed some reported errors

0.003   12 March 2016
        - Fixes for code actions and filters when the match css matches
          more than on node.

0.002   11 March 2016
        - Fix to properly mark scalar ref actions as encoded

0.001   11 March 2016
        - First usable version, with caveats (its still earlly access)
